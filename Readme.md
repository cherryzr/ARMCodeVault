# My ARM Assembly Documentation


zuha <3

Welcome to the ARM Assembly Documentation Repository! This repo aims to serve as a meaningful resource for learning and referencing basics of ARM assembly language, providing a collection of documentation, examples, and basic commands to get you started on your journey into the world of ARM architecture.

A wise person once said "everything is open source if you can read assembly"

## Introduction to ARM Assembly

ARM assembly language is a low-level programming language used for programming ARM architecture processors. It provides direct access to the processor's instruction set and architecture, allowing for precise control over the hardware. Understanding ARM assembly is essential for systems programming, embedded development, and optimizing performance-critical code.

Hence this is my attempt to learn Assembly, to you know make those LEDs on my pi go crazy :D

## Basic Commands

This repository includes documentation and examples for fundamental ARM assembly commands, including but not limited to:

- `MOV`: Move data from one location to another.
- `ADD`: Add two values together.
- `SUB`: Subtract one value from another.
- `CMP`: Compare two values.
- `LDR`: Load data from memory into a register.
- `STR`: Store data from a register into memory.
- `B`: Unconditional branch to a label.
- `BEQ`, `BNE`, `BGT`, `BLT`: Conditional branching based on comparison results.

Refer to the individual documentation files in the repository for detailed explanations and examples of each command.
